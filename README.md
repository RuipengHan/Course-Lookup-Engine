<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About our project: CourseHub
Our original intention was to provide students a convenient tool to look up UIUC courses' information and make reviews and ratings about them. This idea orginates from the GPA disparity project: https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/
